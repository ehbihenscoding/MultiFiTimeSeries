# The best   
Multifidelity metamodel adapted to functional inputs and outputs for uncertainties quantification of complex models
It exist 3 branchs: master, oneprocess and cobalt

#### The example:
Pendulum in all branch (same as in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832018311232)

The Lorentz system in the branch Lorentz (for more details https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)

#### Project status:
the master branch is a fully working branch

oneprocess is the in progress branch

cobal is the branch for cluster computer
