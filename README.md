# Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling of time-series outputs 
Multifidelity metamodel adapted to functional inputs and outputs for uncertainties quantification of complex models
It exist 3 branchs: master, oneprocess and cobalt

### The example:
Pendulum in all branch (same as in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832018311232)

The Lorentz system in the branch Lorentz (for more details https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)

### Project status:
the master branch is a fully working branch

oneprocess is the in progress branch

cobal is the branch for cluster computer. All the figures in the article were constructed with this branch.

## How to run the code:
The code is in R. Initialy design on R 3.6 but it also run on R 4.1

If you want to run an example of the model run the file Make1plot.R
If you want to compare all methods run MakeExp.R
